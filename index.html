            Ideal for a group of 5 like we had but also with a variety of
            experience. They managed to cater for us all without being separated
            and kindly took photos of us with a great view of the beach. It
            seemed great for all abilities!

            Our two young girls had a fab time doing the half hour lesson and
            half hour ride on Nan and Jerry. The staff were lovely and friendly.
            Fantastic beginners experience will definitely be back

            Friendly, professional staff who ensured we had a horse to meet our
            ability and we were able to ride together even though my partner is
            a complete novice and I am competent. I was led off separately for a
            couple of canters then re-joined my partner which was perfect. Would
            definitely recommend.
